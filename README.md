## <del>Cascading</del> *Cascalog* for the Impatient

Welcome to Cascalog for the Impatient, a series of tutorial 
and [Cascalog](http://www.cascalog.org/) code examples to get you started. This series is a fork of [Cascading for the
Impatient](http://www.cascading.org/category/impatient/).

This set of progressive coding examples starts with a simple file copy and builds up to a MapReduce implementation of the TF-IDF algorithm.

When you are ready, clone this repository and head over [to the Wiki to follow through with the 6-part tutorial](https://github.com/Quantisan/Impatient/wiki).

## Prerequisites

Install the following:

1. Hadoop, see Apache's instruction on [setting up a local node](http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/GettingStartedWithHadoop)
2. [Leiningen build tool for Clojure](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen)

Some basic knowledge of [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) and using Leiningen would be helpful.

## TO-DO

### Part 7
* Implements switch to run the example in local mode (without Apache Hadoop)
* Uses [Incanter](https://github.com/liebke/incanter) to analyze/visualize the results

### Catch-up
* Generating DOT file
* create Gists of outputs

### Write-up
* installation and setup guide
* update each README
* a step-by-step tutorial for each part explaining Cascalog concepts and
best practices
