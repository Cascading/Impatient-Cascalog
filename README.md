## <del>Cascading</del> *Cascalog* for the Impatient

Welcome to Cascalog for the Impatient, a series of tutorial 
and [Cascalog](http://www.cascalog.org/) code examples to get you started. This series is a fork of [Cascading for the
Impatient](http://www.cascading.org/category/impatient/).

This set of progressive coding examples starts with a simple file copy and builds up to a MapReduce implementation of the TF-IDF algorithm.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository and head over [to the Wiki to follow through with this 6-part tutorial](https://github.com/Cascading/Impatient-Cascalog/wiki).

## Prerequisites

Install the following:

1. Hadoop, see Apache's instruction on [setting up a local node](http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/GettingStartedWithHadoop)
2. [Leiningen build tool for Clojure](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen)

Some basic knowledge of [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) and using Leiningen would be helpful.
